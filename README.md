<h2> Overview: </h2>

This app allows you to make a donation to a charity on behalf of someone as a gift for them. You can then send them a card by selecting an occasion (e.g. birthday) with either a default or a customized message and image. The app is in progress, and only the features below work.

A welcome page will display. You can select a category (of charities) on the left, then select one of the charities. It then shows on the right a URL for the charity from where you can make a donation. The only occasion currently supported is a Birthday. Also on the right, you can customize your card's messages, and click the "Send Donation and Card" button, whhich only saves the card information.
